# Website-Monitoring-HAWT PKM KC 2023 "Yawing- based Sistem Monitoring Berbasis IoT untuk Meningkatkan Performa Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine." This GitHub repository houses the code and resources for an IoT sensor website designed to monitor the current, voltage, and RPM (rotations per minute) of a wind turbine. 
This GitHub repository houses the code and resources for an IoT sensor website designed to monitor the current, voltage, and RPM (rotations per minute) of a wind turbine. The project utilizes a NodeMCU development board and is intended to be hosted on a local server, typically accessed through the localhost address.

Features:
- Real-time Sensor Data: The website provides real-time monitoring of the wind turbine's current, voltage, and RPM readings, allowing users to track the performance and health of the turbine.
- NodeMCU Integration: The NodeMCU development board is used as the main controller for acquiring sensor data and transmitting it to the website. The repository includes the necessary firmware and code for programming the NodeMCU.
- Localhost Hosting: The website is designed to be hosted on a local server, accessed through the localhost address. This setup ensures that the data remains private and can be easily accessed within the local network.
- Interactive Web Interface: The website presents the sensor data in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner. It includes interactive charts, graphs, and visualizations that allow users to analyze and interpret the data effectively.
- Historical Data Logging: The system stores historical sensor data, enabling users to view past performance trends and conduct in-depth analysis. The repository includes a database schema and queries for data storage and retrieval.
- Alerts and Notifications: The website is equipped with an alerting system that can notify users of critical events or abnormal readings from the wind turbine. Users can configure thresholds and receive notifications via email or other preferred methods.
- Documentation and Setup Guide: The repository includes comprehensive documentation and a setup guide that provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the NodeMCU, deploying the website on localhost, and configuring the various components of the system.
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in building an IoT-based wind turbine monitoring system using NodeMCU and hosting it on a local server. It offers a reliable solution for tracking crucial parameters and ensuring optimal performance of wind turbines.
